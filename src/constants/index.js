        content: [`The latest advancements in field of research and technology especially in cyber physical systems 
                   have propelled its extensive inclusion in robotics. Cyber physical systems enable robots to communicate 
                   with humans and other robots in the surrounding environment and accomplish assigned tasks collaboratively. 
                   The recent trends in deployment of multiple robot systems in warehouses and search-rescue operations has 
                   inspired us to work on the project. Controlling a swarm of robots through ROS is simplified due to its highly intricate 
                   architecture of communication through nodes which enables sensor and control integration with ease. The 
                   interaction between robots and humans over a remote interface helps the operator to guide the robot which 
                   enables the implementation of the concept “Supervised Autonomy.” Autonomous Intelligent robot control is 
                   always the desired way forward but achieving that requires expensive controllers and higher levels of AI. 
                   We are trying to explore an effective way to control the robot remotely and we aim to restrict some 
                   cognitive decision making of the robot and stream the decision making over a remote interface through an 
                   operator which is termed as “cognitive collaboration.” This also helps in performing tasks in areas that 
                   pose high risk for humans to do it themselves.`],

                   because the intent of the user is identified based on the keyword present in the spoken phrase. When an alarm 
                   is set, the timing should be specified along with am/pm. It is observed that not more than one alarm/reminder 
                   can be set in a single execution. Our assistive robot is programmed such that the user cannot terminate an ongoing 
                   task until and unless it gets completed. The advantage of our robot is that the conversion of speech into text and 
                   vice-versa is possible without an internet connection. The major breakthrough to detect the user by recognizing its 
                   face and calling the user by its name is achieved. LBPH algorithm is used where the model is trained with single image 
                   by which it can find the face encodings and store it locally. On every iteration, it checks the user’s face, extracts 
                   face encodings and compares it with the encodings stored locally and labels it. Face Recognition takes within fraction 
                   of second but the response time depends upon the microprocessor. It is observed that the face recognition process fails 
                   when the person face is tilted and background lighting is illuminated less than 60% on the face. Also, it is unable to 
                   detect the user if the user is moving and not facing to the camera.`],
